# 👋 Hi, I’m @Benzou65.
👨‍💻 A passionate web developer with over 4 years' experience, I started my career as a Fullstack developer before specialising in Frontend. This transition was motivated by my interest in the dynamism and complexity of the user interface.

🌐 My passion for technology drives me to stay at the forefront of industry trends. I devote time every day to technology watch, whether through blog posts, conferences or following opinion leaders on social networks.

🏢 I'm currently part of an international team at the Chantelle lingerie group, where I work full remote. My role is to optimise the user experience across all their online shops, helping to create intuitive and engaging interfaces.
